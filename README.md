**Weather Data Analysis & Forecasting Project : **

**📌 Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and forecast temperature and precipitation trends using historical weather data. The workflow includes:

1) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3) Time Series Forecasting

4) Model Evaluation & Insights


**📊 Data Source & Cleaning -**

The dataset consists of temperature, precipitation, and timestamp features.

Missing values were handled using median/mode imputation.

Outliers were treated using the capping method (1st and 99th percentile).

Data normalization was applied where necessary.

**🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Trend Analysis: Line plots for temperature & precipitation changes over time.

Outlier Detection: Boxplots to detect anomalies.

Correlation Analysis: Heatmap to study variable relationships.

**Sample Visualization **

Model Used: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing

Feature for Time Analysis: lastupdated

**Metrics for Evaluation**

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
